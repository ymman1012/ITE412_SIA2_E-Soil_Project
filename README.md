### 📝 Short Description
The E-Soil: IoT and AI-Enabled Soil Analysis System is designed to optimize fertilizer use in Philippine agriculture. 
By using IoT sensors, the system collects real-time soil data such as moisture, pH, temperature, and nutrient levels (N, P, K). 
This data is processed with AI algorithms to provide precise, crop-specific fertilizer recommendations. 
Farmers and agronomists can access insights through a user-friendly mobile and web application, which also tracks historical soil health trends. 
The system aims to promote sustainable farming by improving crop yield, reducing fertilizer waste, lowering costs, and minimizing environmental impacts like nutrient runoff.
