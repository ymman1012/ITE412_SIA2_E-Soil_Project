# Project Overview  

## 1. System Objectives  
The project aims to solve the problem of inefficient fertilizer use in Philippine agriculture by developing an IoT- and AI-enabled system that provides real-time soil analysis and accurate fertilizer recommendations. This helps farmers reduce costs, improve soil quality, and minimize environmental impacts such as nutrient runoff.

## 2. Proposed Scope  
The system will include the following module:  
- *Soil Data Collection Module* – Log in / Sign up for tourists.  
- *Data Analysis Module* – Tourists can search destinations and track locations.  
- *User Interface Module* – Tourists can submit feedback about their experience.  
- *Data Storage & Tracking Module* – Tourism officers can add, edit, or delete events.  

## 3. Stakeholders  
- *Farmers* – Primary users who will rely on the system for fertilizer management and soil monitoring. 
- *Agronomists/Researchers* – Secondary users who analyze data for sustainable farming practices and provide expert validation. 

## 4. Tools/Technologies  
- *IoT Sensors:* Soil moisture, NPK, Temperature
- *AI/Machine Learning algorithms:* For Data Analysis  
- *Mobile Application Development:* Flutter 
- *Database & Cloud Storage:* Firebase 
- *Programming Language:* Dart
